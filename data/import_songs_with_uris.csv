Alicia Keys,,,_W44NZvHc9I,,,40.758,-73.9855,"Times Square, New York City","“Empire State of Mind” is effectively a musical postcard of New York City, and Times Square is the most instantly recognizable symbol of the city’s intensity: neon billboards, crowds flowing like tides, and that constant sense that something is happening right now. The song’s identity is welded to the idea of arriving in NYC and feeling both swallowed whole and energised—exactly the emotional whiplash Times Square delivers in person. Standing in the plaza, you’re surrounded by theatre marquees, giant screens, street performers, and tourists; it’s a place where New York sells itself as spectacle. This SoundScape pin uses **Lyrics / Cultural Landmark** as the anchor, so the location is the storytelling device as much as the song itself. If you visit Times Square, New York City today, look for the everyday details—signage, street layout, nearby venues, and the way people move through the space—because those textures explain why this spot feels like the song’s natural home.
