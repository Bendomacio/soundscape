user-1770132896796,"Wouldn't It Be Loverly",Audrey Hepburn,,,,,,51.5120331456165,-0.122861317847708,Covent Garden,"""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"" is famously set in and around the bustling, gritty Covent Garden Market of Edwardian London in the musical My Fair Lady. The Scene: The song is performed early in Act I by the Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, along with her street friends. The Context: Amidst the dirty, crowded atmosphere of the Covent Garden fruit-and-vegetable market, Eliza sings about her dream of a better life—a room with a chair, a roaring fire, and chocolate. The Location: It opens the show, directly following Professor Henry Higgins' encounter with Eliza near the portico of St Paul's Church, Covent Garden. While the 1964 film was entirely shot on Warner Bros. studio stages in California, the set design for these opening scenes aimed to recreate the bustling atmosphere of the real London location.",,live

Warner Brothers had to pay the residents of Picket Post Close a large fee for using their neighbourhood in the film, as well as for the inconvenience of all the filming equipment. When it came time to shoot the second film, it was decided it was easier and cheaper to shoot at Leavesden Studios where an actual Privet Drive set was built, as the residents continued to demand further payments. Picket Post Close was used in the first and fifth films.",,live
